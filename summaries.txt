Beauty seems simple; we know it when we see it. But of course our ideas about what is attractive are influenced by a broad range of social and economic factors, and in Beauty and Business leading historians set out to provide this important cultural context. How have retailers shaped popular consciousness about beauty? And how, in turn, have cultural assumptions influenced the commodification of beauty? The contributors here look to particular examples in order to address these questions, turning their attention to topics ranging from the social role of the African American hair salon, and the sexual dynamics of bathing suits and shirtcollars, to the deeper meanings of corsets and what the Avon lady tells us about changing American values. As a whole, these essays force us to reckon with the ways that beauty has been made, bought, and sold in modern America.

"Centennial edition of an under-rated short story writer and novelist, Roque's wonderful edition will help to recover this Salvadoran master of the esoteric and the oral tradition. Generally considered the best Salvadoran writer of the 20th century, rightly admired by Gabriela Mistral, Salarrué mixed the vernacular and the fantastic without disdain for perverse psychologies. Each work has a solid examination of variants by Roque, and longer works like El señor de la burbuja (1927) and the tales of O-Yarkandal (1929/1971), both included in vol. 1, put in perspective the avant-garde initiatives of other Spanish American writers of the period. In vol. 2, Roque revises and provides the fullest collection of Salarrué's folkloric tales Cuentos de cipotes (1945/1971; see HLAS 38:6579 and HLAS 40:6653), which complement the complicated and rich stories for which he is best known, Cuentos de barro (1934), included in vol. 1. Vol. 3, also edited masterfully by Roque, includes Salarrué's last stories; a short novel; and his longest work, Catleya luna (1974/1980; see HLAS 40:6652), written in the 1950s according to Roque, but published much later"--Handbook of Latin American Studies, v. 58.

The growth of agricultural productivity is widely believed to be low.  But this study finds the productivity rate in agriculture to be higher than that in manufacturing, both on average and for groups of countries at different stages of development.  This suggests that a large agricultural sector need not be a disadvantage for growth performance, and may be an advantage.
During a period of trade liberalization (1985-89), when Mexican manufacturing experienced an important inflow of foreign direct investment, manufacturing sectors with heavy foreign direct investment received greater protection in import-competing sectors.  With the move toward greater openness, the influence of industrial and foreign-investor lobbying on policy formation was reduced.
A positive historical shock to external spreads can lead to an increase in domestic spreads and a reduction in the cyclical component of output.  Shocks to external spreads immediately after the Mexican peso crisis had a sizable effect on movements in output and domestic interest rate spreads in Argentina.
In a country where financial intermediation is highly inefficient (with the enforcement costs of loan contracts very high, for example), or in one experiencing great volatility and large adverse shocks in output, the likelihood of an inefficient equilibrium is great.  In East Asia it may be in the interests of both debtors and creditors to collectively reduce the face value of debt, to reduce inefficiencies in the financial sector.
Property rights in China are moving in two different directions.  In some villages, private rights are secure and to some degree marketable; in other villages, individual rights are increasingly restricted and suject to more regulation and reallocation.  Administrative reallocation tends to promote more equal access to land, but the price paid for the social insurance of land tenure may be forgone investment.
There may be a compelling discontinuity to financial sector development in that banks need to be supported early in development but need to be "weakened" later, at the expense of bank rents, to foster further development.  The important question for policy is when and how to generate and manage this discontinuity so that it is not forced on society by costly and traumatic events such as bank failures.
Countries need suitable mechanisms for balancing the risks and benefits of financial openness, including mechanisms through which to provide insurance to citizens, through the marketplace or through redistributive policy, and thus to avert political pressure for capital controls.  Capital mobility as a policy objective gained currency and support only after significant trade liberalization and only in democratic countries that had established the ability to repond to citizens' demands for national economic security.
The increase in investment abroad during the past two decades may help explain the simultaneous worldwide rush toward free trade.  The entry of foreign capital may change the political game, increasing openness to international trade no matter what form the foreign capital takes (whether entering by acquiring equity in existing domestic firms or by bringing foreign firms into the host economy) or what its trade orientation (whether it enters the export or import-competing sector).
In China, where collectives own farmland but farmers may hold "use rights" to the land, a case can be made for a property rights system with incomplete security of tenure but with strong transfer rights, which permit "specialization without regret"-- so farmers can recoup the value of an investment even if they exit farming.
Some corruption of employees will exist when managers are constrained in setting rewards and penalties.  Attempts to reduce corruption need to address these constraints.  Raising salaries without raising expected penalties will have higher costs than benefits.
When foreign aid undermines institutions, countries can become aid-dependent, even if donors and recipients have the best intentions.
Small states, no different from large states in income and growth, should receive the same policy advice large states do.  Because of their greater openness, they may be more vulnerable to volatility in terms-of-trade shocks--but their openness pays off in growth.
A survey of more than 50 empirical papers shows that the adjustment costs of trade liberalization are small relative to the benefits.  Moreover, manufacturing employment typically increases with trade liberalization.  The limited data suggests that trade liberalization reduces poverty.
In this sample of 49 Latin America, OECD, and transition economies, it is the ineffective and discretionary administration of tax and regulatory regimes--not higher tax rates alone--as well as corruption, that increases the size of the unofficial economy.  And countries with a large unofficial economy tend to grow more slowly.

It is difficult to design and implement an effective safety net for banks, because overgenerous protection of banks may introduce a risk-enhancing moral hazard and destabilize the very system it is meant to protect.

At first glance, Hubbert appears to be presenting both pro and con agruments regarding the suitability of dancing. However, the discussion is weighted toward the common discourse found in this genre of antidance literature. Hubbert argues that although dance was practiced in biblical times, it was performed by and for women. Additionally, he concludes that dance is bad for the health and a waste of time and money.
This detailed travelogue, the concluding part of a two-volume work written primarily for a British readership, discusses the United States' geological resources and offers critical observations about the manners and customs of its different peoples. It was written over a decade after the author explored St. Peter's River--the "Minnay Sotor" of the book's title--in 1835, and draws upon the journals he kept along the way. A Canoe Voyage (volume 2) deals with Featherstonhaugh's return journey to the east coast. His route, interrupted by many detours and excursions through what is now the state of Wisconsin, took him from Fort Snelling and Galena to St. Louis and its environs. Traveling by steamer along the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers to Paducah, Kentucky, Featherstonhaugh then journeyed down the Tennessee River to Tuscumbia, where he caught a train to Decatur. From this point, he journeyed by steamer, stage, and dugout canoe, to areas described as "Cherokee country," then onward to Georgia, the Carolinas,Virginia, and Washington, D.C, his ultimate destination. In this volume, Featherstonhaugh inveighs against fraudulent land speculators, slavery, the treatment of the Cherokee, and the bad manners of fellow travelers. He found much to admire in the beauty of the Southern Appalachians and the hospitality of John C. Calhoun, the celebrated Southern statesman.
Peter Hardeman Burnett (1807-1895) spent his early years in Tennessee and Missouri, serving as a district attorney in the latter state. In 1843 he joined an emigrant party bound for Oregon, where he became a prominent and controversial lawyer, judge, and politician in the new territory. In 1848, he went to California in search of gold and soon became a business and political leader of that territory. Recollections and opinions of an old pioneer (1880) contains Burnett's recollections of his early life in Missouri, his career in Oregon, and his decision to join a wagon train to California in the summer of 1848. There he seeks gold for six months before resuming the practice of law and the pursuit of politics. Elected a judge in August and governor in December 1849, Burnett turned to the practice of law in the 1850s and the business of banking in the 1860s. He touches on his various professional pursuits and his home life in Sacramento.
This is a small compendium of statistics, charts, timetables, and political information published by the Michigan Central Railroad. It includes lists of members of state boards, the state legislature, and officers of military regiments. Population figures, vote tallies, and numbers drawn from the report of the state treasurer for fiscal year 1884 accompany useful commercial intelligence such as the locations of local post offices and national banks or names and sites of regional newspapers. Thee are schedules for railroads and circuit courts, and a brief geographical and historical summary. Advertisements range from notices of available land to railroad routes, heating devices, tobacco, insurance, and hotels and restaurants. Much of the book's material directly or indirectly promotes the Michigan Central Railroad.
This pamphlet brings together a series of letters originally published in theChicago Price Current under the pseudonym Massabesic. They chronicle the writer's travels through Michigan's towns and cities by the Michigan Central Railroad as well as by water transportation and coach. Schooley emphasizes the growth and financial development of these burgeoning communities in the late 1860s. He discusses each town's local attractions, newspapers, educational and religious facilities, fiscal health, sources of wealth, retailing and distribution of goods, and agricultural and industrial production; however, he does not always provide the same amount of information for every community. Schooley also includes "An Essay on the Credit System," which analyzes the pitfalls of extending credit and buying "on time,"and an essay on the "Commercial Independence of the Northwest," which encourages the manufacture and distribution of the Upper Midwest's finished products through Chicago.
This pamphlet consists of photographs of views and landmarks in various locales along the southern shore of Lake Superior: Marquette, St. Ignace, Ishpeming, Champion, Collinsville, Sault Ste. Marie, and Mackinac Island. The scenes include several large hotels, picturesque landscapes, Father Marquette's grave, locks around the waters of the Sault accommodating large ships, the International Railway Bridge, and the Lake Superior Iron Mine. B.F. Childs of Marquette, Michigan is the photographer, and he evidently intended the pamphlet to appeal to the tourist trade, since the illustrations are arranged as if in a souvenir scrap-book.
This descriptive discussion of the Lake Superior country emphasizes geographical features and is directed primarily towards those interested in locating and exploiting the region's mineral deposits of copper and iron. Nevertheless, it is written as a travel narrative, with the author progressing along the shoreline areas, noting their scenic beauties and providing anecdotes and opinions along the way. The reader is told what to wear and what transportation facilities and amenities will be found en route. The book lists mining companies already functioning in the area and gives information about their management and the nature of their operations. Among other information, there is also a glossary of mining terms, a list of grantees, a short vocabulary of French and local Indian words, and a list of steamship and sailing vessels.
This is an account by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft (1793-1864) of his discovery of the Mississippi River's source, Lake Itasca, in 1832. Schoolcraft was an Indian agent for the region, and he assembled an expeditionary party of thirty, including Ozawindib (an Ojibway guide and interpreter), an army officer, a surgeon, a geologist, and interpreter, and a missionary. They set out with instructions from Secretary of War Lewis Cass to effect a permanent peace among the region's Native Americans, persuade them to be vaccinated against smallpox, acquire demographic and scientific information, and establish definitively the origin of the Mississippi. Expedition Through the Upper Mississippi contains anecdotes and observations about the beliefs, customs, and history of the Chippewa [Ojibway] as well as the Sioux [Dakota], the Fox [Mesquakie], the Sauk, the Menominee, the Mandans, and various other Native American groups. The narrative proceeds chronologically along the route the expedition followed, with detailed descriptions of geographical features. This volume also includes a short account of a trip along the St. Croix and Burntwood (Brule) River, and has an appendix containing statistical and linguistic data, a list of shells collected by Schoolcraft in the West and Northwestern territories, official reports, a speech by six Chippewa chiefs about the war delivered at Michilimackinac in July 1833, and a discussion of the Upper Mississippi's lead-mining country.
Correspondence of W.B. Reed relating to certain letters, attributed to Gen. Samuel Smith, Gen. Anthony Wayne and others, reflecting on the character of Gen. Jos. Reed.  First published in 1842 and reprinted in 1856, the letters were attacked as forgeries by W.B. Reed, grandson of Jos. Reed.
Trouting on the Brule River is a literary account of genteel sportsmen's fishing expeditions during the summers of 1875 and 1877. Originally published in the Chicago Sunday Times and the Chicago Sunday Tribune, the book's chapters tell how a group of Chicago lawyers traveled by rail, foot and canoe to destinations along the Menominee, Michigami, and Brule Rivers in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The author describes the delights of fly-fishing in lyrical detail, along with bobbing for pike, shooting rapids, deer and duck hunting, and encounters with birds and animals. He romanticizes the expedition's Indian guides, believing that they lived in a state of nature.
The first part relates to the polar exploration of William Barents; the second, to early settlements of the Dutch in Maine and a later conquest by a naval expedition about 1674-1676.
In a series of letters, William Darby (1775-1854), who describes himself as a member of the New-York Historical Society, chronicles his journey up the Hudson, across New York to Ogdensburg and Sackett's Harbor (on Lake Ontario), and on to Buffalo and Detroit. Along the way, he spends time in Rhinebeck, Utica, Geneva, Niagara Falls, and other points of scenic or economic interest. He also discusses the St. Lawrence River and its commercial traffic at length, analyzing development on both shores and comparing the United States's and Canada's growth. Darby made the trip across Lake Erie from Buffalo to Detroit on the schooner Zephyr, stopping at such towns as Dunkirk, Cleveland, and Sandusky. His return trip to New York took him back along the American shore of Lake Erie to Buffalo and Albany (by way of Auburn, the Finger Lakes, and Schenectady). Appended to these letters are "general remarks" (which include excerpts of a speech by Governor Clinton to the New York State Legislature), a description of Ballston Spa, a letter Darby received about the not-yet-opened Erie Canal, and long excerpts from Bouchette's Canada. Darby tells us primarily about the geology and natural features of the areas he visits as well as their current and future economic prospects. He provides some demographic information and occasionally mentions local accommodations. The book is accompanied by two colored maps, one of which details the route he took for his journey.
This book recounts the experiences of a young, genteel wife adjusting to the military life and frontier conditions of life at Fort Winnebago, Wisconsin, in the early 1830s. She describes her perilous journeys back and forth to the early settlement of Chicago, her complex cultural encounters with a diverse frontier society, and her determination to instill her own standards of civilized behavior and Christian observance. There is abundant information on the customs, folklore, economic practices, life-cycle events, medical treatments, diet, warfare, environmental responses, social hierarchies, and gender roles of the different groups of people that Kinzie comes to know best. She also provides detailed portraits of individual native Americans, voyageurs, fur traders, missionaries, pioneers, soldiers, and African Americans who impressed her positively or negatively. As pieces of local and family history, Kinzie retells stories of settlers captured by Indians; battle scenes from the wars with the British, the Sioux (Dakota) and other native Americans; and the fall of Fort Dearborn.
John Ross Browne (1817-1875) of Kentucky, the official reporter for the California State Constitutional Convention of 1849, came to California in 1849 as an employee of the government revenue service. He traveled widely in the next two decades, including a stay in China as U.S. minister, before settling down in Oakland in 1870. Crusoe's island (1864) contains four short works: (1) Crusoe's island, an account of his visits to Juan Fernandez, the island off the Chilean coast where Alexander Selkirk's experiences are supposed to have been the basis of Defoe's Robinson Crusoe; (2) A dangerous journey, an account of Browne's 1849 journey by horseback from San Francisco to San Luis Obispo; (3) Observations in office, which summarizes his experiences as a functionary of the Treasury Department sent to the Pacific Coast in 1858 to examine customs houses, with chapters on a controversy in Port Townsend, Washington, concerning the sale of liquor to Native Americans and on the exploitation of Native Americans in California; and (4) A peep at Washoe, inspired by the latest "rush," that for gold in the Washoe region of the Sierra Nevada, including Browne's reflections on mining fevers and his recollections of his own travels through Nevada and California mining districts.
A narrative of travel in Washington Territory in 1853 and on the Isthmus of Panama in the preceding year.
Samuel McNeil left his shoemaking business in Lancaster, Ohio, in January 1849 for a trip to the California gold fields via Panama. Unlike many 49ers, he had sense enough to return home when he had accumulated enough gold to meet his needs. McNeil's travels in 1849 (1850) recounts the shipwreck that forced McNeil and his compatriots to travel overland from Texas to Mazatlán, where they obtained passage to San Francisco. He then describes prospecting at Smiths Bar on the North Fork of the American River, Bear River, Weaver's Creek, and other Feather and Trinity Rivers camps until August, when he took his stake of 2,000 and booked passage east.
A native of Frederick, Maryland, Luther Melanchthon Schaeffer sailed around the Horn to California in 1849. He spent most of the next two-and-a-half years in the gold fields, mining on the Feather River, Deer Creek, Grass Valley (Centerville) and other Nevada County sites. Sketches of travels in South America, Mexico and California (1860) gives an excellent picture of the international, interracial community of miners, with comments on social patterns, creation of local government, vigilance committees, and legal disputes in this society. Schaeffer also describes visits to San Francisco and Sacramento, Mexico, and Panama before his return to the East in 1852.
Benjamin Franklin Taylor (1819-1887) won renown as a war correspondent for Chicago newspapers during the Civil War. In peacetime he became a freelance writer best known as a poet. Between the gates (1878) is an account of Taylor's journey by train from Chicago to San Francisco in the 1870s and his summer in California. The trip west is covered in great detail as is his lengthy stay in San Francisco, with its Chinatown. From there, he journeys by rail to the Sonoma Valley, on to the geysers and petrified forest, the Russian River and Mammoth Cave, continuing by horseback through the San Joaquín Valley to the Yosemite. Briefer attention is given to his rail trip to Southern California with stops at Tehachapi, the Mojave Desert, Los Angeles, and the San Gabriel mission.
Edward S. Parkinson was a New Jersey newspaperman who traveled to California and Alaska in 1892. Wonderland, or Twelve weeks in and out of the United States (1894) is his account of that three-month adventure: a rail trip from New Jersey to California with side trips to Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. Highlights include visits to the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Yosemite, Portland and Shoshone; with a chapter on California resort hotels.
This promotional pamphlet provides brief descriptions of popular tourist destinations along the Upper Midwestern route of the Chicago and North-Western Railway in 1884. The Michigan communities of Escabana, Gogebic, Marquette, and Menominee are included, as are the Minnesota towns of Stillwater, Lake Madison, and Waseca. The information in the entries is not always consistent, but usually includes sites of interest, hotels and rooming houses (with occasional prices), and commentary on the health-restoring properties of the local air and water. A "How To Get There" section accompanying each entry alerts the reader to the number of trains going to a particular place as well as the best routes to travel. Engravings and a map accompany the text, as do a few tables analyzing the chemical properties of water. The pamphlet also includes brief descriptions of Yellowstone and other resorts further west, and an advertisement for the Chicago and Northwestern Railway itself.
Alexander Campbell, a state representative from Marquette, presented this address on February 6, 1861 to the Michigan State Legislature, which resolved that 5,000 copies of it be printed and distributed. Campbell extols the resources and development prospects of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and attempts to balance prevailing assumptions about its frigid climate and long winters with positive descriptions of its dry, clean air and therapeutic value for invalids, particularly during the summer months. Among the area's natural advantages, Campbell cites natural harbors, abundant fisheries, mineral wealth (especially iron and copper), lumber (vast stands of hardwood timber), and agricultural potential. Though the winter air might be too bracing for those suffering from tuberculosis, Campbell believes that it virtually eliminates the feverish colds and barking coughs of damper, more changeable climates. He argues, however, that highways and ports must be developed to improve transportation and export of the region's products.
Hubert Howe Bancroft (1832-1918) moved to California from Buffalo, New York, in 1852. After a brief exposure to gold mining, he returned to the profession of bookselling, setting up shop in Crescent City. In 1856, he moved to San Francisco, where he founded H.H. Bancroft & Co., which soon became the state's premier bookseller and publisher. From 1871 to 1889, Bancroft labored on his Native races and history of the Pacific states, western Canada, and Alaska, which he published beginning in 1874, hiring qualified authors for the volumes and even sending out field workers who obtained dictated reminiscences from surviving pioneers. Literary industries: a memoir (1891) recounts his early life and experiences in California. He recounts his career as a businessman and his growing fascination with his hobbies of collecting books on Pacific Coast history and amassing the source materials for a multi-volume study of the subject. This is a book about the writing of history and preservation of source materials as well as the recollections of a leading early California businessman.
Discusses panorama of the battle by Theo. Poilpot.
This book provides full-page biographies of men prominent in Michigan's business, professional, political, educational, and cultural life in the late nineteenth century. Although the entries are not in alphabetical order, there is an alphabetical index on pp. xi-xiv. The entries are preceded by an extensive selection of historical background materials under such headings as "The Civil Commonwealth," "The Military Record," "Educational," "Material Interests," "Religious Organizations," and "Miscellaneous" (which discusses the political parties, liquor traffic, including prohibition laws, and also provides tables). The religion section includes information about church doctrine and polity for mainline denominations, and the educational section summarizes major institutional issues and conflicts at the University of Michigan.
This antidance treatise was directed at the large German-speaking population that settled in the midwestern section of the United States. Pfefferkorn's two main arguments are common in this genre of literature: dance is a waste of time and money and, additionally, is bad for the health. The author concludes that dance is sinful and dangerous, leading to carnal appetites and immoral thoughts and actions.
Rabbit is busy planting his garden and has no time to play the Easter Bunny this year. Pooh and his friends decide to help him plant, and in no time it is done, allowing Rabbit once again to play the Easter Bunny.
Susie Champney Clark was a Boston matron who visited California as a member of an organized rail tour forty years after the Gold Rush. The round trip from the Hub to the Golden gate (1890) describes that rail trip, with special attention to stops at Chicago, Pasadena, Santa Barbara, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Oakland, Sonoma County, the Lick Observatory, Santa Cruz, Monterey, Yosemite, and Salt Lake City.
Charles Warren Stoddard (1843-1909) and his family left Rochester, New York, for California in 1855. In the 1870s and 1880s, he became a well known writer of travel books, most notably his South-Sea Idylls. He taught at Notre Dame and the Catholic University of America before retiring to California at the end of his life. In the footprints of the padres (1902) recalls Stoddard's boyhood and family life in San Francisco: schools, Chinatown, social life, Happy Valley, and the Vigilance Committee. He also describes a voyage to New York in 1857 with his ailing older brother and offers miscellaneous anecdotes of California missions, Monterey, and Theresa Yelverton.
While United States consul to France (1861-1864), Bigelow wrote États-Unis d'Amérique en 1863 in order to counteract the apparent desire of the French people for a  dissolution of the American Union, by showing them the relative importance of the commerce of the northern and southern states.
This small book was written to serve as an introduction for American children to the history, culture, and society of Puerto Rico at the turn of the century. It is clearly written and contains maps, illustrations and anecdotes intended to hold the interest of English-language readers, ages 10 to 15. In spite of its age, the book is still informative. The author's narrative is accurate, vivid and detailed and gives the reader a excellent snapshot of Puerto Rican life and culture before the introduction of North American influences. Recommended for all ages.
Regimental orderly book of the 5th Pennsylvania (formerly the 4th) under command of Col. Anthony Wayne. During these 3 months following Carleton's attempted invasion of October, 1776, the garrison at Ticonderoga consisted first of 5 brigades under direct command of Gen.

Helen Hunt Jackson (1830-1885) of Amherst, Massachusetts, turned to writing after the death of her first husband in 1863. Her marriage to William Jackson, a wealthy Denver Quaker, brought her to the West in 1875, and she soon became a Native American rights activist. She was sent west as part of a federal commission to investigate conditions among the Mission Indians in 1882, and her experiences as part of that commission inspired her famous 1884 novel Ramona. Glimpses of California (1902) reprints articles Jackson first published in 1883. She offers a narrative history of the California mission system and the early years of Los Angeles as a Hispanic community and the work of Junipero Serra as well as an analysis of the fate of the Mission Indians after those missions were dismantled. This section of the book is followed by a chapter on Southern California's "outdoor industries" -- livestock ranching and farming -- and one on Jackson's visit to Oregon.
Originally published in 1762 and reissued in 1765, this work borrows heavily from previously published materials, including the works of Locke, Goldini, and especially John Weaver's 1712 An Essay towards a history of dancing. Gallini (1728-1805) presents a history of dance, arguments for learning the art of dance, and a discourse on the minuet. Especialy interesting are Gallini's comments on European and non-European dance, and discussion includes practices in Britain, Spain, Naples, the peasants of Tirol, Russia, Turkey, China, Africa, and the Americas.
Loraine Pratt Immen (b. 1840) of Grand Rapids, Iowa, visited California in the winter and spring of 1896. Letters of travel (1896?) first appeared in a local newspaper. Mrs. Immen reported visits to Echo Mountain, San Diego, greater Los Angeles, Yosemite, Oakland, Santa Clara, San José, and San Francisco.
Concerning the relative number of troops furnished by Massachusetts and Indiana, in 1861 and 1862.  Also, comparing the military service of Massachusetts and other New England states, with that of the southern states during the revolution.
This is the autobiographical account of an explorer, government administrator, and scholar whose researches into the language and customs of the Chippewa and other Native American peoples of the Great Lakes region are considered milestones in nineteenth-century ethnography. After a childhood in Hamilton, New York, Schoolcraft gained attention for the reports and journals he wrote on trips west to explore mineral deposits in Arkansas, Missouri, and the old Northwest. Later, he joined the Cass expedition to the Lake Superior region, where he served as an Indian agent in St. Mary (Sault Ste. Marie) from 1822 to 1836. During that time, he continued to make regular exploratory journeys. On one of these, in 1832, he located the Mississippi River's source at Lake Itasca, Minnesota. From 1836 to 1841, Schoolcraft served as Michigan's superintendent of Indian Affairs and helped to bring about a treaty with the Ojibwa (1836), who as a result relinquished their claims to most of northern Michigan. Schoolcraft's memoirs are noteworthy for their detailed geographic, geological, political, military, folkloric, historical, and ethnographic information. Married to a woman of Native American background, he was sympathetic to certain aspects of the Indian societies he encountered. Nevertheless, he saw the sweep of new settlers into Indian lands as inevitable, and accepted as necessary the removal of Native peoples beyond the advancing boundaries of the Unites States. Schoolcraft believed that soldiers, diplomats, federal officials, and missionaries could do their jobs more effectively if they learned native languages and understood Indian customs. These motives, along with his literary aspirations, gave rise to his explorations of Indian cultural life. He discusses Indian myths and legends at length and talks about how he transformed them into his own Algic Researches (1839), the work that inspired Longfellow's "Hiawatha." Schoolcraft also corresponded or visited with Washington Irving, Thomas Jefferson, Albert Gallatin, and many of the era's other leading intellectuals, and details his conversations with them.
Charles Cornelius Coffin Painter was an agent of the Indian Rights Association, headquartered in Philadelphia. The condition of affairs in Indian Territory and California (1888) reports Painter's findings at the Seger Colony and Cheyenne, Arapahoe, Anadarko, Iowa, Comanche, Wichita, and Ponca agencies and reservations in the Indian Territory. In California, he visits Indian settlements and reservations at Cohuilla, Agua Caliente, San Ysabel, Mesa Grande, Captain Grande, and San Jacinto. He discusses incursions on Native American lands and schools for the Mission Indians and legal actions on behalf of the San Fernando Indians.
Blackbird (Mack-e-te-be-nessy) was an Ottawa chief's son who served as an official interpreter for the U.S. government and later as a postmaster while remaining active in Native American affairs as a teacher, advisor on diplomatic issues, lecturer and temperance advocate. In this work he describes how he became knowledgeable about both Native American and white cultural traditions and chronicles his struggles to achieve two years of higher education at the Ypsilanti State Normal School. He also deals with the history of many native peoples throughout the Michigan region (especially the Mackinac Straits), combining information on political, military, and diplomatic matters with legends, personal reminiscences, and a discussion of comparative beliefs and values, and offering insights into the ways that increasing contact between Indians and whites were changing native lifeways. He especially emphasizes traditional hunting, fishing, sugaring, and trapping practices and the seasonal tasks of daily living. Ottawa traditions, according to the author, recall their earlier home on Canada's Ottawa River and how they were deliberately infected by smallpox by the English Canadians after allying themselves with the French. Blackbird finds Biblical parallels with Ottawa and Chippewa accounts of a great flood and a fish which ingests and expels a celebrated prophet. He includes his own oratorical "Lamentation" on white treatment of the Ottawas, twenty-one moral commandments of the Ottawa and Chippewa, the Ten Commandments and other religious material in the Ottawa and Chippewa language, and a grammar of that language. Henry Rowe Schoolcraft appears in the narrative in his role as an Indian agent.
Captain Jacob Nix, a German immigrant, was the commander of the citizen forces defending New Ulm, Minnesota during the Sioux uprising of 1862. In this German language text, he provides a narrative account of the events and an unflattering portrayal of the Sioux.
A Southern Methodist minister, Oscar Penn Fitzgerald (1829-1911) of North Carolina was sent to California as a missionary by his denomination in 1855. He remained for more than twenty years, winning appointment as state superintindent of public education in 1867 despite his pro-Southern position during the Civil War. In the late 1870s, Fitzgerald returned to the East, editing the Nashville Christian Advocate, 1878-1890, and accepting appointment as a Southern Methodist bishop. California sketches (1880) is the first of his books dealing with his stay in California, providing brief anecdotes of his life in California in the mid 1850s: pastorate of churches in the gold-mining town of Sonora, 1855-1856, and in Santa Rosa and Santa Clara; editing the Pacific Methodist Advocate in San Francisco; and conflict between Northern and Southern Methodist churches in California.

Theodore Augustus Barry (1825-1881) and Benjamin Ada Patten (1825-1877) established their credentials as California pioneers by arriving in their adopted state before January 1, 1850. Men and memories of San Francisco (1873) gives later arrivals a detailed picture of the city as it existed a few months before California statehood. They describe the streets and the residences and business that lined each thoroughfare and alley as well as the men and women who owned those homes, boarding-houses, hotels, restaurants, saloons, stores, offices, and shops. They also chronicle the fire of May 1851 which destroyed so many of the structures they describe. While they focus on the city as it was in early 1850, their sketches of its residents extend further, often forming capsule biographies of their subjects.
Clarence King (1842-1901) of Rhode Island was a Yale-educated geologist and mining engineer who rode horseback across the continent in 1863. In California, he was hired to work on Whitney's geological survey of the state, and he went on to a distinguished professional career. Mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada (originally published 1872) begins with a summary of the geological history of the Sierras and then recounts King's experiences in the range, both as a member of the Whitney expedition and as a mountain climber, 1864-1870.

Salvador Brau was a historian, novelist, journalist, and essayist born in the western Puerto Rican town of Cabo Rojo in 1842.  This book is a compilation of journalism articles written between 1880 and 1894.  The last two decades of the nineteenth century were a time of intense political ferment in Puerto Rico.  The book reveals the author's knowledge of the forces contributing to the rapid change in the island's political and social climate.  Among the essays included in this work are "En plena luz" (Exposed), which exposes Brau's political principles and his opinions about Puerto Rico; "Así como nosotros" (Just Like Us), which studies the political conditions in the island; "Busquemos el orígen" (Let's Find the Origin), which discusses the relationships among Spanish settlers in the Americas and the colonies' needs for freedom; and "La Disciplina" (Discipline), which explains the principles and ethics a political party should follow in a democratic society.
The Lares Revolt of 1868 sought the abolition of slavery, freedom of the press and commerce, and the independence of Puerto Rico. Six hundred men, led by liberals, drew up a provisional constitution and declared the Puerto Rican Republic, but they were defeated in their first clash with Spanish troops. Despite the movements quick defeat, during the 20th century the revolt has come to be viewed as the beginning of Puerto Rico's struggle for independence. Pérez Morís opposed Puerto Rican independence, but his work has served as an important study of the revolt.
Maurice Farrar was an Englishman authorized by Minnesota in 1880 to act as an Agent for the promotion of Immigration through lecturing in Great Britain. He spent five years in Minnesota during the late 1870s and, upon his return home, published this promotional work extolling the farming life there. The preface makes clear his intention of encouraging inhabitants of Britain to emigrate to a land seemingly unaffected by agricultural depression. His favorable review of Minnesota centers on Fairmont, in Martin County, which he describes as an "English colony" settled by natives of Great Britain from all walks of life. He then talks about the woods of Fillmore County and the town of Chatfield which he follows with a visit to a Chippewa reservation, White Earth. For much of the rest of the book, Farrar discusses sports, politics, and social life, finishing with a detailed exploration of factors that might induce one to emigrate. An appendix of agricultural crops, ploughing, appropriate housing and other practical information concludes this volume.
This amply-illustrated promotional guidebook, issued by the General Passenger Department of the Duluth South Shore & Atlantic Railway, describes in great detail the sights and recreational opportunities afforded visitors along Lake Superior's South Shore. The author follows the route from Sault Ste. Marie west to Duluth, including Marquette, Presque Isle and Macinac as well as other major stopover points, providing much local and geological history along the way. In words and pictures, the book depicts picturesque landmarks and scenic landscapes, mining, manufacturing, logging operations, fishing, hunting, and other wilderness activities, with some attention to the region's Indian groups.
Iñigo Abbad y Lasierra (1745-1813) was a Spanish-born Catholic priest who became secretary to the bishop of Puerto Rico in 1773 and remained on the island for ten years. Abbad's Historia, originally published in Spain, is considered the first modern historical work on Puerto Rico. It begins with the Spanish discovery and conquest of the island and ends in the late eighteenth century. Chapters twenty through forty are devoted to the study of the island's climate, economy, population, geography and natural history. Acosta's edition is an annotated and enlarged version of Abbad's work, published eighty years after the original. Acosta brought the Historia up-to-date (1866) and incorporated much new information that had not been available to Abbad. Acosta added his corrections and additions to the end of each chapter. As Acosta approached his own time, he incorporated much new historical information. He also used his annotations as a vehicle to advocate the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico and encourage Spain to reduce Puerto Rican trade barriers.
De Córdoba, who was secretary to the Captain General of Puerto Rico, 1816-1836, continued the history of Puerto Rico where Abbad left off and provided a rich resource of information on the island for the years 1783 to 1831. His work, however, is less than objective in its evaluation of Spanish rule during the period under study, and he attempts to justify continued Spanish control over Puerto Rico. De Córdoba was an eye-witness of some events described in the book. His narrative includes vivid descriptions and commentaries about historical personalities, based on his own personal experiences. He also emphasizes economic and statistical data about the island. The last chapter contains a useful list of Puerto Rican governors and religious leaders (from the Taino Indians until the early 1830s). The first volume of this six-volume set was published in the 1866 edition of Iñigo Abbad y Lasierra's Historia geográfica, civil v natural.
Van Middledyk's work was the first major historical study of Puerto Rico in English. Van Middledyk advanced Puerto Rican historiography by building on the works of Brau, Coll y Toste, and Acosta, and by consulting early Spanish chronicles. A librarian at the Free Public Library of San Juan, Van Middledyk possessed knowledge of and access to considerable primary source material. His history is sympathetic to the Indians and highly critical of Spanish colonial administration. Coming in the wake of American military occupation, the book sought to explain and justify control of the island by the United States.
Although the title of this manual would indicate a collection of cotillons (figure dances usually performed by four couples), the dances are, in fact, English country dances, performed by a column of men facing a column of women. The collection includes directions for fifty English country dances.
